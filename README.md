Challenges overcomed during the project: There were a number of problems to overcome in the project including connection of the database, model, and GUI together among other things. One major problem area was that of the serialization of the project. Initially we tried following the implementation of serialization demonstrated in the demo at Javadocs, however that proved to be something that would apply to our project as our file structure and organization required a more in-depth approach. In addition, another issue was that of the backtrackerâ€™s implementation. The backtracker had an original goal of determining whether certain movements were possible in the maze and whether reaching the end was possible at any given room in the maze. This required a lot of traversal through the maze and the keeping track of paths traveled and potentially traveled.

Total development hours for the project: Around 210 hours were given by all team members. Develped in 5 weeks using an agile approach, maintaining user stories and backlog on Pivotal Tracker.
